    "For Madeline and Teagan\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book would not exist if not for Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics, by\nRichard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus.",
    "It is the book I learned discrete math out of,\nand that I taught with the semester before I began writing this text.",
    "I wanted to\nmaintain the inquiry-based feel of their book but update, expand, and rearrange\nsome of the material.",
    "Some of the best exposition and exercises here were graciously\ndonated from this source.\n",
    "Thanks go to the graduate students who have co-taught the Discrete Mathematics\ncourse with me over the years, including Evan Czysz, Alees Lee, and Sarah Sparks,\nwho helped develop new activities and exercises that have been incorporated into\nthis text.",
    "Michelle Morgan provided copy-editing support, and Jennifer Zakotnik-\nGutierrez helped code many of the interactive exercises in the online version of the\nbook.",
    "Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge, and Richard Grassl (again) for\ntheir suggestions after using parts of this text in their classes.\n",
    "The online version of the book is written in PreTeXt and hosted on Runestone\nAcademy thanks to the tremendous development work of Rob Beezer, Brad Miller,\nDavid Farmer, and Alex Jordan along with the rest of the participants of the\npretext-support group1.\n",
    "Finally, a thank you to the numerous students who have pointed out typos and\nmade suggestions over the years, and a thanks in advance to those who will do so in\nthe future.\n",
    "1groups.google.com/g/pretext-support\nvii\n\n\nPreface\nThis text aims to introduce select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate\nfor first- or second-year undergraduate math and computer science majors, especially\nthose who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics.",
    "The book began\nas a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern\nColorado.",
    "This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as\nthe bridge course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate introduction\nto proofs course.",
    "As this course has evolved to support our computer science\nmajor, so has the text.",
    "The current version of the book is intended to support\ninquiry-based teaching for understanding that is so crucial for future teachers,\nwhile also providing the necessary mathematical foundation and application-based\nmotivation for computer science students.",
    "While teaching the course in Spring\n2024 using an early version of this edition, I was pleasantly surprised by how many\nstudents reported that they, for the first time, saw how useful math could be in the\nreal world.",
    "I hope that this experience can be replicated in other classes using this\ntext.\n",
    "This book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem-oriented or\ninquiry-based methods.",
    "Each section begins with a preview of the content that\nincludes an open-ended Investigate!",
    "motivating question, as well as a structured\npreview activity.",
    "The preview activities are carefully scaffolded to provide an\nentry-point to the sections topic and to prime students to engage deeply in the\nmaterial.",
    "Depending on the pace of the class, I have found success assigning only\nthe section preview before class, using the preview activity as in-class group work,\nor assigning the entire section to be read before class (each section concludes with a\nsmall set of reading questions that can be assigned to encourage students to actually\nread).",
    "For those readers using this book for self-study, the organization of the\nsections will hopefully mimic the style of a rich inquiry-based classroom.\n",
    "The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of the students I\nteach at UNC.",
    "The main areas of study are logic and proof, graph theory, combina-\ntorics, and sequences.",
    "Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences.\n",
    "Discrete structures are introduced as needed, but a more thorough treatment of\nsets and functions is included as a separate chapter, which can be studied indepen-\ndent of the other content.",
    "The final chapter covers two additional topics: generating\nfunctions and number theory.\n",
    "While I believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free\nto skip around to what interests you.",
    "There are occasionally examples and exercises\nthat rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum, and they\nusually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study.",
    "If\nyou are an instructor, you can also create a custom version by editing the PreTeXt\nsource to fit your needs.\n",
    "ix\n\nx\nImprovements to the 4th Edition.\n",
    "Many of the sections have been rewritten to\nimprove the clarity of the exposition.\n",
    " Nearly 300 new exercises, bringing the total to more than 750.",
    "These are better\ndivided into preview activity questions, reading questions, practice problems,\nand additional exercises.",
    "Most of the new exercises are interactive for the\nonline version.\n",
    " New sections on probability, relations, and discrete structures and their proofs.\n",
    "Some other sections have been split up to make it more likely that a single\nclass period can be devoted to a single topic.\n",
    " Improved presentation for the counting chapter with a focus on considering\nsets of outcomes more than following rules.\n",
    "activities of the 3rd Edition have been split into two types:\nInvestigate!",
    "questions and Preview Activities.",
    "The former are open-ended\nquestions designed to engage you with the topic soon to be discussed.",
    "The\nlatter are structured preview activities that you should be able to completely\nanswer before reading the section.\n",
    "The previous editions (3rd Edition, released in 2019, 2nd Edition, released in\n2016, and the Fall 2015 Edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use\nthose versions due to familiarity.\n",
    "I plan to continue improving the book.",
    "Some of this will happen in real-time\nby updating the online versions to include new content (numbering will remain\nconsistent).",
    "Thus I encourage you to send along any suggestions and comments as\nyou have them.\n",
    "Oscar Levin, Ph.D.\nUniversity of Northern Colorado, 2024\n\nHow to Use This Book\nIn addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage\nyou to interact with the mathematics.\n",
    "Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very\nbeginning of a topic) you will find open-ended questions designed to engage you\nwith the topic soon to be discussed.",
    "You really should spend some time thinking\nabout, or even working through, these problems before reading the section.",
    "However,\ndont worry if you cannot find a satisfying solution right away.",
    "The goal is to pique\nyour interest, so you will read what is next looking for answers.\n",
    "Most sections include a structured preview activity.",
    "These\ncontain leading questions that you should be able to completely answer before\nreading the section.",
    "The idea is that the questions prime you to engage meaningfully\nwith the new content ahead.",
    "If you are using the online version, most of these\nquestions will provide you with immediate feedback so you can be confident moving\nforward.\nExamples.\n",
    "I have tried to include the correct number of examples.",
    "For those\nexamples that include problems, full solutions are included.",
    "Before reading the\nsolution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking.",
    "Unlike\nsome textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all-inclusive for problems you\nwill see in the exercises.",
    "They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other\nproblems.",
    "Instead, use the examples to deepen your understanding of the concepts\nand techniques discussed in each section.",
    "Then use this understanding to solve the\nexercises at the end of each section.\nExercises.\n",
    "You get good at math through practice.",
    "Each section concludes with\npractice problems meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that\nsection; the online version provides immediate feedback on these problems.",
    "There\nare then additional exercises that are more challenging and open-ended.",
    "These\nmight be assigned as written homework or used in class as group work.",
    "Some of the\nadditional exercises have hints or solutions in the back of the book, but use these\nas little as possible.",
    "Struggle is good for you.",
    "At the end of each chapter, a larger\ncollection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of chapter review) which might\nbridge the material of different sections in that chapter.\n",
    "Interactive Online Version.\n",
    "For those of you reading this in print or as a PDF, I\nencourage you to also check out the interactive online version.",
    "Many of the preview\nactivities and exercises are interactive and can give you immediate feedback.",
    "Some of\nxi\n\nxii\nthese have randomized components, allowing you to practice many similar versions\nof the same problems until you master the topic.\n",
    "Hints and solutions to examples are also hidden away behind an extra click to\nencourage you to think about the problem before reading the solution.",
    "There is a\ngood search feature available as well, and the index has expandable links to see the\ncontent without jumping to the page immediately.",
    "There is also a python scratch\npad (the pencil icon)",
    "so you can try out some code if you feel so inclined.\n",
    "Additional interactivity is planned.",
    "These bonus features will be added on a\nrolling basis, so keep an eye out!\n",
    "You can view the interactive version for free at discrete.openmathbooks.org or by\nscanning the QR code below.\n\n",

    "If this is your first time encountering the subject,\nyou will probably find discrete mathematics quite different from other math subjects.\n",
    "You might not even know what discrete math is!",

    "Adjective: Individually separate and distinct.\n",
    "Synonyms: separate - detached - distinct - abstract.\n",
    "Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard.",
    "What is\nmathematics?",
    "The study of numbers?",
    "In part yes, but you also study functions and\nlines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and . . . .",
    "Or perhaps you want\nto say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems.\n",
    "What sort of problems?",
    "Well, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles,\n. . . .",
    "Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of\ndiscrete to it, as defined above.",
    "Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is\nindividually separate and distinct.\n",
    "In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers\n(perhaps they constitute the range of a function).",
    "You would represent this set as an\ninterval: [0, ) is the range of () = 2 since the set of outputs of the function are\nall real numbers 0 and greater.",
    "This set of numbers is NOT discrete.",
    "The numbers in\nthe set are not separated by much at all.",
    "In fact, take any two numbers in the set and\nthere are infinitely many more between them that are also in the set.\n",
    "Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would\nnot be an interval.",
    "Consider the function that gives the number of children of\neach person reading this.",
    "What is the range?",
    "Im guessing it is something like\n{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.",
    "Maybe 5 or 6 is in there too.1 But certainly nobody reading this has\n1.32419 children.",
    "This output set is discrete because the elements are separate.",
    "The\ninputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual\nperson.\n",
    "There are many discrete mathematical objects besides sets of numbers; we will\nintroduce some of these in Section 0.2.",

    "Introduction and Preliminaries\nfocus of discrete mathematics and this book.",
    "However, the reason we want to study\nthese structures is because they provide a way to model real-world problems.2\nTo get a feel for the subject, lets consider the types of problems you solve in\ndiscrete math.",
    "Here are a few simple examples:\nInvestigate!\n",
    "Note: Throughout the book you will see Investigate!",
    "activities like this one.",
    "Answer\nthe questions in these as best you can to give yourself a feel for what is coming next.\n",
    "The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for\nall of his friends.",
    "To kick things off, they decide that everyone should\nshake hands.",
    "Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands\nwith every other person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once,\nhow many handshakes take place?\n2.",
    "At the warm-up event for Oscars All-Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al\nate one hot dog.",
    "Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs.\n",
    "Not to be outdone, Carl ate five.",
    "This continued with each contestant\neating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant.",
    "How many\nhot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat?",
    "How many hot\ndogs were eaten in total?\n",
    "After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial chamber.\n",
    "The room is empty except for two large chests.",
    "On each is carved a\nmessage (strangely in English):\nExactly one of these\nchests contains a treasure,\nwhile the other is filled with\ndeadly immortal scorpions.\n",
    "For either chest, if the\nchests message is true, then\nthe chest contains treasure.\n",
    "The problem is, you dont know whether the messages are true or\nfalse.",
    "What do you do?\n4.",
    "Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to\nbuild roads directly connecting each pair of towns.",
    "While the towns\nhad plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they\nwished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each\nother (as stop signs had not yet been invented).",
    "Also, tunnels and\nbridges were not allowed, for moral reasons.",
    "Is it possible for each of\nthese towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without\ncreating any intersections?\n2Many of the problems discussed in this book are admittedly contrived and clearly fictional, but\nhopefully you will see how these toy problems can be generalized to actually represent problems that\npeople would care about in reality.\n\n",
    "What is Discrete Mathematics?\n3\nAs you consider the problems above, dont worry if it is not obvious to you\nwhat the solutions are.",
    "We are more interested here in what sort of information we\nneed to be able to answer the questions.",
    "How can we represent the situation using\nindividually separate and distinct objects?",
    "Dont read on until you have thought\nabout at least this for each of the questions.\n",
    "Here are some things you might have thought about:\n1.",
    "The people at the party are individuals.",
    "We can consider the set of people.",
    "We\ncan also consider sets of pairs of people, since it takes exactly two people to\nshake hands.",
    "So the question is really, how many pairs can you make using\nelements from a 10-element set?\n",
    "For example, if there were three people at the party, conveniently named 1, 2,\nand 3, then the pairs would be (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).",
    "Or should we include\n(2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 2) as well?\n2.",
    "To count the number of hot dogs eaten, either by an individual or in total,\nwe could use a sequence of integers (whole numbers).",
    "The th term in the\nsequence might represent the number of hot dogs eaten by the th contestant.\n",
    "We can consider a second sequence, also of integers, that gives the total number\nof hot dogs eaten by the first contestants combined.\n",
    "The solution to the problem will then be the value of the 26th term in the\nsequence.",
    "To help us find this, we could consider the rate of growth of the\nsequences, as well as how these two sequences relate to each other.\n",
    "Logic questions also belong under the discrete math umbrella: Each statement\ncan have a value of True or False (and there is nothing in-between).",
    "To answer\nquestions like that of the chests of scorpions, we must understand the structure\nof the statements, and how the truth values of the parts of the statements\ninteract to determine the truth value of the whole statement.\n",
    "The last question is about a discrete structure called a graph, not to be confused\nwith a graph of a function or set of points.",
    "We can use a graph to represent\nwhich elements of a set (or towns) are related to each other (or connected by\na road).",
    "In this case, the question becomes, can we draw a graph with five\nvertices (towns) and ten edges (roads) such that no two edges intersect?\n",
    "The four problems above illustrate the four main topics of this book: combina-\ntorics (the theory of ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways),\nsequences, symbolic logic, and graph theory.",
    "However, there are other topics\nthat are also considered part of discrete mathematics, including computer science,\nabstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some of\nthese, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants).\n",
    "Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to do it.",
    "Lets get\nstarted!",
    "Before we can begin answering more complicated (and fun) problems, we\nwill consider a very brief overview of the types of discrete structures we will be\nusing.\n\n",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\nReading Questions\nEach section of the book will end with a small number of Reading Questions like\nthe ones below.",
    "These are designed to help you reflect on what you have read.",
    "In\nparticular, the final reading question asks you to ask a question of your own.",
    "Thinking\nabout what you dont yet know is a wonderful way to further your understanding of\nwhat you do.\n",
    "Right now, how would you describe what discrete mathematics is about, if\nyou were telling your friends about the class you are in?",
    "Write one or two\nsentences.\n",
    "What questions do you have after reading this section?",
    "Write at least one\nquestion about the content of this section that you are curious about.\n\n",
    "0.2\nDiscrete Structures\n0.2.1\nIntroduction\nInvestigate!\n",
    "A double-six domino set consists of tiles containing pairs of numbers, each\nfrom 0 to 6.",
    "How many tiles are in a double-six domino set?",
    "How many\ndominoes are in a double-nine domino set?",
    "How many dominoes are in a\ndouble-domino set?\n",
    "Try it 0.2.1\nSpend a few minutes thinking about the questions above.",
    "Then write 2-3\nsentences describing your thoughts.",
    "You do not need to find a complete\nsolution, but you should describe what you could try and what you think you\nmight need to do to find a solution.\n",
    "We are taking a problem-solving approach to discrete mathematics: We will\nconsider a large variety of questions that have a discrete feel to them, and consider\nhow to answer those questions (and prove that our answers are correct).",
    "This is not\nthe only way to study discrete math.",
    "Another approach would be to study the tools\nused to solve the problems.",
    "If we were art students, we could study paintbrushes\nand easels and the composition of paint, which would be interesting for sure, but I\nthink it is more enjoyable to actually paint those happy little trees.\n",
    "That said, understanding your tools does help you use them, so in this section,\nwe will consider some basic tools used in discrete mathematics.",
    "We will come back\nto these throughout our studies and understand them better as we need to.\n",
    "The tools in our subject are called discrete structures.",
    "They are the mathematical\nobjects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving.",
    "Structure\nis a good word here, since these things have fairly rigid constraints that make\nthem what they are, just like an apartment building is going to have different\ncharacteristics than an airplane hangar or a suspension bridge (these are types of\nphysical structures, not mathematical structures, just to be overly clear and destroy\nthe metaphor).\n",
    "The structures we will use most in discrete math are sets, functions, sequences,\nrelations, and graphs.",
    "We now briefly preview each of these.",
    "As we progress\nthrough our studies, each will be explored in more detail.\n",
    "0.2.2\nSets\nA set is an unordered collection of elements.",
    "This is fairly vague, but unless we\nwant to spend a whole book trying to understand sets more precisely, it will be\ngood enough for us.",
    "It is possible to define all of mathematics using just sets (even\n5\n\n6\n0.",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\nnumbers can be thought of as sets themselves), but this is also not what we will do.\n",
    "Rather, we want to be able to talk about collections of numbers and other objects,\nand we will collect them in something we call a set.\n",
    "We can describe sets by saying exactly what elements are members of the set.",
    "We\ncould specify this membership in words (e.g., Let be the set of all natural numbers\nless than 10), or by explicitly listing all the elements (e.g., = {3, 5, 7}), or using\nsomething called set comprehension (also called set builder notation).",
    "An example\nof this is = {: < 10}.",
    "We would read that as is the set of natural\nnumbers that satisfy the property that they are less than 10.",
    "More precisely, the \nsymbol represents the natural numbers, which is itself a set: = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}",
    "(this\nshows another way to describe a set).",
    "The symbol means is an element of.",
    "The :\nis read such that and tells us that what comes next is the condition that must be\ntrue of the sets elements.\n",
    "By the way...",
    "In this book, we define the natural numbers to be the whole\nnumbers starting with 0.",
    "Not every book includes 0 in this set.",
    "It largely\ndepends on what area of mathematics you study.\n",
    "Since there are multiple ways to describe the same set, we should be careful\nabout what it means for sets to be the same or different.",
    "A set is determined by its\nmembership, so all four of the following describe exactly the same set:\n1. {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n",
    "2. {1, 2, 1 + 1, 1 + 2, 2 + 2}.",
    "(How many numbers belong to this set?",
    "Its not 5.)\n",
    "3. {2, 4, 1, 3}.",
    "(All that matters is what elements are in the collection, not what\norder they were written down in.)\n",
    "4. {: < 5 and 1}.\n",
    "There are lots of things you can do with sets, which we will consider in more\ndetail as we need to.",
    "We will see that it is often helpful to build new sets from\nones we already have (by taking the union or intersection of sets, for example), to\ncompare sets (asking if one set is a subset of another), and to find the number of\nelements of a set (called its cardinality).",
    "We might also want to match up elements\nof one set with another: To do this, we might use a function, which we will discuss\nnext.",
    "Awesomely, we can also use sets themselves to describe functions.",
    "Lets check\nit out.\n0.2.3\nFunctions\nOne way to define a function is as a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.\n",
    "The output is called the image of the input.",
    "Functions also come equipped with a\ndomain, the set of all inputs, and a codomain, the set of all allowable outputs.",
    "You\nmight also speak of the range of the function, which is the set of all actual outputs,\nor put another way, the set of all images of elements from the domain.\n\n",
    "Discrete Structures\n7\nWe write : to describe a function with name , domain and codomain\n.",
    "This does not tell us which function is though.",
    "To define the function, we must\ndescribe the rule.",
    "Often this is done with a formula (for example, () = 2 says\nthat each element of the domain is mapped to its square), or in words (like how we\njust described the squaring function).",
    "We could also define a function with a table\nor a graph.\n",
    "The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for\neach input.",
    "That is, the rule must be a good rule.",
    "What output do we assign to the\ninput 7?",
    "There can only be one answer for any particular function.\n",
    "Since a function maps one set (the domain) to another set (the codomain), there\nis an obvious connection between sets and functions.",
    "There is another connection\nworth considering though: The graph of a function is often described as a set of\npoints.",
    "Here is an example.\n",
    "Example 0.2.2\nConsider the function : {1, 2, 3} {2, 4, 6} defined by () = 2.",
    "If we\nwanted to plot a graph of this function, we would draw the points (1, 2), (2, 4),\nand (3, 6) (but we would not connect these points with lines, since we are\nstudying discrete math; the domain only contains three elements, not the\ninfinitely many between them).\n",
    "So associated with the function is the set of points {(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)}.",
    "In\nfact, this set of points is associated exactly with this (and only this) function.\n",
    "So we can think of this set of points as the function itself.\n",
    "Of course, we are using a mathematical object here: an ordered pair.",
    "This is not\na set (since sets are unordered).",
    "How should we talk about ordered things?",
    "We will\ntake this question up in the next section.\n",
    "There is one more important consideration about how we define a function with\na rule.",
    "A closed formula is one in which each output is given by an explicit rule\nbased solely on its input.",
    "This is what most of us think of as a formula.",
    "For example,\n()",
    "= 3+ 1 is a closed formula, since to find (5) (say) we take the input 5 and do\nsomething to it: Multiply it by 5 and then add 1.\n",
    "What else could a formula possibly be?",
    "A recursive definition of a function tells\nus how to compute the output for a given input based on other outputs of the function.\n",
    "For example, we might insist that () = 2  (1).",
    "If we also specify an initial\ncondition that (0) = 3, then we can find (1)",
    "= 2  3 = 6, and then (2)",
    "= 2  6 = 12,\nand so on.",
    "What is (5) here?",
    "The only way to answer that is to find (4), which\nmeans we need to find (3), which we could do, since we have computed (2).\n",
    "Recursive definitions of functions might be less useful for finding a particular\noutput, but they are often easier to specify for a particular application.",
    "We will\nexplore this phenomenon more when we study sequences.",
    "Speaking of which...\n\n8\n0.",
    "Introduction and Preliminaries\n0.2.4\nSequences\n",
    "Sometimes we are interested not just in a collection of numbers, but in what order\nthose numbers appear.",
    "In such cases, we cannot use sets, since they do not distinguish\nbetween the order of their elements.",
    "Instead, we consider sequences.\n",
    "We will consider both finite and infinite sequences.",
    "A finite sequence may be\nsomething as simple as (1, 2, 3); that is a sequence with 3 elements, in that particular\norder.",
    "We might also call this an ordered triple, the same way that (7, 3) is an\nordered pair.",
    "In general, we could call this an -tuple if it has elements (we assume\nthat tuples are ordered).\n",
    "The key difference between the sequence (1, 2, 3) and the set {1, 2, 3} is that we\ncare about the order.",
    "That is, the sequence (1, 2, 3) is different from the sequence\n(2, 3, 1), while the set {1, 2, 3} is identical to {2, 3, 1}.\n",
    "We will often use sequences as a counting tool.",
    "For example, a very simple\ncounting question is, How many wheels do 100 cars have?",
    "Instead of answering\njust this one question, we could generalize and ask how many wheels cars have,\nand get a sequence of answers.",
    "This yields the infinite sequence (4, 8, 12, . . .).",
    "The\norder these multiples of 4 appear in is important, since each number in the sequence\ncorresponds to a specific version of the question.\n",
    "It is fine to think of a sequence of numbers as an ordered list.",
    "We can refer to the\nterms simply as\n0, 1, 2, . .",
    "and might refer to the entire sequence as ()0 or ().\nIf we want to be a little more precise and more abstract, we can think of a sequence\nas a function.",
    "The domain is the natural numbers or some subset of consecutive\nnatural numbers (like {1, 2, 3, 4}).",
    "The codomain is some set.",

    "There can only be one -th term for any particular value of .",
    "So\nfor any input (the position of the term), there is only one output (the term).",
    "It would\nbe perfectly reasonable to write (4) = 3, and that really does look like a function.\n",

    "Here we introduce some common language to address this question.\n",
    "Definition 1.2.6 Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse.\n",
    "Given an implication , we say,\n",
    "The converse is the statement .\n",
    "The contrapositive is the statement .\n",
    "The inverse is the statement, .\nExample 1.2.7\nConsider the implication, If you clean your room, then you can go to the\nparty.",
    "Give the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of this statement\nSolution.\n",
    "The converse is, If you can go to the party, then you clean your\nroom.\n",
    "The contrapositive is, If you cant go to the party, then you dont clean\nyour room.\n",
    "The inverse is, If you dont clean your room, then you cant go to the\nparty.\n",
    "Symbolically, both the converse and the contrapositive switch the order of the two\nparts of the statement (or alternatively, think about turning the arrow to point in the\nother direction).",
    "The contrapositive and the inverse take the negation of both of the\nstatements.",
    "Notice that if you take the converse (switch the order) and then take the\ncontrapositive of that converse (switch the order back and negate both parts) you get\nthe inverse.",
    "So the inverse is nothing more than the contrapositive of the converse.\n",
    "Or the converse of the contrapositive, which is a fun fact to mention at parties.\n",
    "When considering statements with quantifiers, we ignore the outside quantifiers\nwhen forming the converse, contrapositive, and inverse.\n\n",
    "Logic and Proofs\nQuantifiers and the Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse.\n",
    "A quantified implication (() ()) has:\nConverse\n(() ())\n",
    "Contrapositive\n(() ())\n",
    "Inverse\n(() ())\n",
    "Note 1.2.8 It is unlikely that we would encounter a statement of the form\n(() ()), since this would be automatically true if there was any\nthat made () false.",
    "But if we did, the same rules would apply to the\nconverse, contrapositive, and inverse as above: Just ignore the quantifier when\nswapping and/or negating the parts of the implication.\n",
    "For example, For all shapes, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle (i.e.,\nall squares are rectangles) has the converse, For all shapes, if the shape is a rectangle,\nthen it is a square (so all rectangles are squares).\n",
    "Well, thats not true!",
    "There exist shapes that are rectangles and are NOT squares.\n",

    "This is true.",
    "In\nfact, the contrapositive of a true statement is always true!\n",
    "Since the contrapositive of an implication always has the same truth value as its\noriginal implication, it can often be helpful to analyze the contrapositive to decide\nwhether an implication is true.\n",
    "Example 1.2.9\nTrue or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then\nyou will have at least three cards all of the same suit.",
    "Is the converse true?\nSolution.\n",
    "The original implication is a little hard to analyze because\nthere are so many combinations of nine cards.",
    "But consider the contrapositive:\nif you dont have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you dont have\nnine cards.",
    "It is easy to see why this is true.",

    "2It turns out the Pythagorean Theorem is one such statement.",
    "It is also true that if 2 + 2 = 2,\nthen there is a right triangle with legs of lengths and and hypotenuse of length .",

    "The converse: If you have at least three cards of the same suit, then you\nhave nine cards.",
    "This is false.",
    "You could have three spades and nothing\nelse.",
    "Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we\nprovided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards\nof the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine\ncards).",

    "So assume the hypothesis: Between every\npair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path.",
    "To prove that is a tree, we\nmust show it is connected and contains no cycles.\n",

    "Notice that both directions had two parts:\nthe existence of paths, and the uniqueness of paths (which related to the fact that\nthere were no cycles).",
    "In this case, these two parts were really separate.",
