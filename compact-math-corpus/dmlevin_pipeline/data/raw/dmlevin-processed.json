        "For Madeline and Teagan\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book would not exist if not for “Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics,” by\nRichard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus.",
        "It is the book I learned discrete math out of,\nand that I taught with the semester before I began writing this text.",
        "I wanted to\nmaintain the inquiry-based feel of their book but update, expand, and rearrange\nsome of the material.",
        "Some of the best exposition and exercises here were graciously\ndonated from this source.\n",
        "Thanks go to the graduate students who have co-taught the Discrete Mathematics\ncourse with me over the years, including Evan Czysz, Alees Lee, and Sarah Sparks,\nwho helped develop new activities and exercises that have been incorporated into\nthis text.",
        "Michelle Morgan provided copy-editing support, and Jennifer Zakotnik-\nGutierrez helped code many of the interactive exercises in the online version of the\nbook.",
        "Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge, and Richard Grassl (again) for\ntheir suggestions after using parts of this text in their classes.\n",
        "The online version of the book is written in PreTeXt and hosted on Runestone\nAcademy thanks to the tremendous development work of Rob Beezer, Brad Miller,\nDavid Farmer, and Alex Jordan along with the rest of the participants of the\npretext-support group1.\n",
        "Finally, a thank you to the numerous students who have pointed out typos and\nmade suggestions over the years, and a thanks in advance to those who will do so in\nthe future.\n",
        "1groups.google.com/g/pretext-support\nvii\n\n\nPreface\nThis text aims to introduce select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate\nfor first- or second-year undergraduate math and computer science majors, especially\nthose who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics.",
        "The book began\nas a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern\nColorado.",
        "This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as\nthe “bridge” course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate “introduction\nto proofs” course.",
        "As this course has evolved to support our computer science\nmajor, so has the text.",
        "The current version of the book is intended to support\ninquiry-based teaching for understanding that is so crucial for future teachers,\nwhile also providing the necessary mathematical foundation and application-based\nmotivation for computer science students.",
        "While teaching the course in Spring\n2024 using an early version of this edition, I was pleasantly surprised by how many\nstudents reported that they, for the first time, saw how useful math could be in the\n“real world.”",
        "I hope that this experience can be replicated in other classes using this\ntext.\n",
        "This book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem-oriented or\ninquiry-based methods.",
        "Each section begins with a preview of the content that\nincludes an open-ended Investigate!",
        "motivating question, as well as a structured\npreview activity.",
        "The preview activities are carefully scaffolded to provide an\nentry-point to the section’s topic and to prime students to engage deeply in the\nmaterial.",
        "Depending on the pace of the class, I have found success assigning only\nthe section preview before class, using the preview activity as in-class group work,\nor assigning the entire section to be read before class (each section concludes with a\nsmall set of reading questions that can be assigned to encourage students to actually\nread).",
        "For those readers using this book for self-study, the organization of the\nsections will hopefully mimic the style of a rich inquiry-based classroom.\n",
        "The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of the students I\nteach at UNC.",
        "The main areas of study are logic and proof, graph theory, combina-\ntorics, and sequences.",
        "Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences.\n",
        "Discrete structures are introduced “as needed”, but a more thorough treatment of\nsets and functions is included as a separate chapter, which can be studied indepen-\ndent of the other content.",
        "The final chapter covers two additional topics: generating\nfunctions and number theory.\n",
        "While I believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free\nto skip around to what interests you.",
        "There are occasionally examples and exercises\nthat rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum, and they\nusually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study.",
        "If\nyou are an instructor, you can also create a custom version by editing the PreTeXt\nsource to fit your needs.\n",
        "ix\n\nx\nImprovements to the 4th Edition.\n",
        "Many of the sections have been rewritten to\nimprove the clarity of the exposition.\n",
        "• Nearly 300 new exercises, bringing the total to more than 750.",
        "These are better\ndivided into preview activity questions, reading questions, practice problems,\nand additional exercises.",
        "Most of the new exercises are interactive for the\nonline version.\n",
        "• New sections on probability, relations, and discrete structures and their proofs.\n",
        "Some other sections have been split up to make it more likely that a single\nclass period can be devoted to a single topic.\n",
        "• Improved presentation for the counting chapter with a focus on considering\nsets of outcomes more than following rules.\n",
        "•",
        "The Investigate!",
        "activities of the 3rd Edition have been split into two types:\nInvestigate!",
        "questions and Preview Activities.",
        "The former are open-ended\nquestions designed to engage you with the topic soon to be discussed.",
        "The\nlatter are structured preview activities that you should be able to completely\nanswer before reading the section.\n",
        "The previous editions (3rd Edition, released in 2019, 2nd Edition, released in\n2016, and the Fall 2015 Edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use\nthose versions due to familiarity.\n",
        "I plan to continue improving the book.",
        "Some of this will happen in real-time\nby updating the online versions to include new content (numbering will remain\nconsistent).",
        "Thus I encourage you to send along any suggestions and comments as\nyou have them.\n",
        "Oscar Levin, Ph.D.\nUniversity of Northern Colorado, 2024\n\nHow to Use This Book\nIn addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage\nyou to interact with the mathematics.\n",
        "Investigate!",
        "questions.\n",
        "Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very\nbeginning of a topic) you will find open-ended questions designed to engage you\nwith the topic soon to be discussed.",
        "You really should spend some time thinking\nabout, or even working through, these problems before reading the section.",
        "However,\ndon’t worry if you cannot find a satisfying solution right away.",
        "The goal is to pique\nyour interest, so you will read what is next looking for answers.\n",
        "Preview Activities.\n",
        "Most sections include a structured preview activity.",
        "These\ncontain leading questions that you should be able to completely answer before\nreading the section.",
        "The idea is that the questions prime you to engage meaningfully\nwith the new content ahead.",
        "If you are using the online version, most of these\nquestions will provide you with immediate feedback so you can be confident moving\nforward.\nExamples.\n",
        "I have tried to include the “correct” number of examples.",
        "For those\nexamples that include problems, full solutions are included.",
        "Before reading the\nsolution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking.",
        "Unlike\nsome textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all-inclusive for problems you\nwill see in the exercises.",
        "They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other\nproblems.",
        "Instead, use the examples to deepen your understanding of the concepts\nand techniques discussed in each section.",
        "Then use this understanding to solve the\nexercises at the end of each section.\nExercises.\n",
        "You get good at math through practice.",
        "Each section concludes with\npractice problems meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that\nsection; the online version provides immediate feedback on these problems.",
        "There\nare then additional exercises that are more challenging and open-ended.",
        "These\nmight be assigned as written homework or used in class as group work.",
        "Some of the\nadditional exercises have hints or solutions in the back of the book, but use these\nas little as possible.",
        "Struggle is good for you.",
        "At the end of each chapter, a larger\ncollection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of “chapter review”) which might\nbridge the material of different sections in that chapter.\n",
        "Interactive Online Version.\n",
        "For those of you reading this in print or as a PDF, I\nencourage you to also check out the interactive online version.",
        "Many of the preview\nactivities and exercises are interactive and can give you immediate feedback.",
        "Some of\nxi\n\nxii\nthese have randomized components, allowing you to practice many similar versions\nof the same problems until you master the topic.\n",
        "Hints and solutions to examples are also hidden away behind an extra click to\nencourage you to think about the problem before reading the solution.",
        "There is a\ngood search feature available as well, and the index has expandable links to see the\ncontent without jumping to the page immediately.",
        "There is also a python scratch\npad (the pencil icon)",
        "so you can try out some code if you feel so inclined.\n",
        "Additional interactivity is planned.",
        "These “bonus” features will be added on a\nrolling basis, so keep an eye out!\n",
        "You can view the interactive version for free at discrete.openmathbooks.org or by\nscanning the QR code below.\n\n",
