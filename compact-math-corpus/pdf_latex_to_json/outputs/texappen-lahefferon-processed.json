    "For more, <cit.> is excellent.",
    "Two other sources, available online, are\n<cit.> and <cit.>.",
    "Statements\n\n\n\nFormal mathematical statements come labelled as a \nTheorem \nfor major points,\na Corollary \nfor results that follow immediately from\na prior one, or a\nLemma \nfor results chiefly used to prove others.",
    "Statements can be complex and have many parts.",
    "The truth or falsity of the entire statement depends both on the\ntruth value of the parts and on how the statement is\nput together.",
    "Not\nWhere P is a proposition,\n`it is not the case that P' is true provided that P is\nfalse.",
    "For instance, `n is not prime' is true only when n is the\nproduct of smaller integers.",
    "To prove that a `not P' statement holds, show that P is false.",
    "And\nFor a statement  of the form `P and Q'\nto be true both halves must hold:\n`7 is prime and so is 3' is true, while\n`7 is prime and 3 is not' is false.",
    "To prove a `P and Q', prove each half.",
    "Or\nA `P or Q' statement is true when either half holds:\n`7 is prime or 4 is prime' is true, while `8 is prime\nor 4 is prime' is false.",
    "In the case that both clauses of the statement are true, \nas in `7 is prime or 3 is prime',\nwe take the statement as a whole to be true.",
    "(In everyday speech people occasionally use `or' in an \nexclusive way“Live\nfree or die” does not intend both halves to holdbut\nwe will not use `or' in that way.)\n\nTo prove `P or Q', show that in all cases at least one\nhalf holds (perhaps sometimes one half and sometimes the other,\nbut always at least one).",
    "If-then\n\nAn `if P then Q' statement may also appear as\n`P implies Q' or `P Q' or \n`P is sufficient to give Q' or `Q if P'.",
    "It \nis true unless P is true while Q is false.",
    "Thus `if 7 is prime then 4 is not' is true \nwhile `if 7 is prime then 4 is also prime' is false.",
    "(Contrary to its\nuse in casual speech, in mathematics `if P then Q' \ndoes not connote that\nP precedes Q or causes Q.)\n\nNote this consequence of the prior paragraph: \nif P is false then `if P then Q' is\ntrue irrespective of the value of Q:\n`if 4 is prime then 7 is prime' and\n`if 4 is prime then 7 is not' are both true statements.",
    "(They are vacuously true.)\nAlso observe that `if P then Q' is true when Q is true: \n`if 4 is prime then 7 is prime' and \n`if 4 is not prime then 7 is prime' are both true.",
    "There are two main ways to establish an implication.",
    "The first way is direct: assume that P is true and use that\nassumption to prove Q.",
    "For instance,\nto show `if a number is divisible by 5 then twice that\nnumber is divisible by 10' we can assume that the number is 5n and\ndeduce that 2(5n)=10n.",
    "The indirect way is to prove the \ncontrapositive\nstatement: `if Q is false then P is false'\n(rephrased, `Q can only be false when P is also false').",
    "Thus to show `if a natural number is prime then it\nis not a perfect square' we can \nargue that if it were a square p=n^2 then it could be\nfactored p=n· n where n<p and so wouldn't be prime\n(p=0 or p=1 don't satisfy n<p but they\nare nonprime).",
    "Equivalent statements\n\nSometimes, not only does P imply Q but\nalso Q implies P.",
    "Some ways to say this are:\n`P if and only if\nQ', `P iff Q', `P and Q are logically\nequivalent', `P is necessary and sufficient to give Q',\n`P Q'.",
    "An example is `an integer is divisible by ten if and only if  \nthat number ends in 0'.",
    "Although in simple arguments a chain like \n“P if and only if R, which holds if and only if S …”\nmay be practical, to prove that statements are equivalent we more often\nprove the two halves\n`if P then Q' and `if Q then P' separately.",
    "Quantifiers\nCompare these statements about natural numbers:\n`there is a natural number x such that x is\ndivisible by x^2' is true, while\n`for all natural numbers x, \nthat x is divisible by x^2' is false.",
    "The prefixes `there is' and `for all' \nare quantifiers.",
    "For all\nThe `for all' prefix is the \nuniversal quantifier, \nsymbolized ∀.",
    "The most straightforward way to prove that \na statement holds in all cases is to \nprove that it holds in each case.",
    "Thus to show that `every number divisible by p has its\nsquare divisible by p^2', take a single number of the form\npn and square it (pn)^2=p^2n^2.",
    "This is a typical element proof.",
    "(In this kind of argument be careful not to assume \nproperties for that element\nother than the ones in the hypothesis.",
    "This argument is wrong:\n“If n is divisible by a prime, say 2, so that n=2k\nfor some natural number k,\nthen n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2 and the square of n is divisible\nby the square of the prime.”\nThat is a proof for the special case p=2 \nbut it isn't a proof for all p.",
    "Contrast it with a correct one:\n“If n is divisible by a prime\nso that n=pk for some natural number k\nthen n^2=(pk)^2=p^2k^2 and so the square of n is divisible\nby the square of the prime.”)\n\n\n\n\nThere exists\nThe `there exists' prefix is the \nexistential quantifier,\nsymbolized \n∃.",
    "We can prove\nan existence proposition by producing something satisfying\nthe property: for instance, to settle the question of primality of\n2^2^5+1, Euler exhibited the divisor 641<cit.>.",
    "But there are proofs\nshowing that something exists without saying how to find it;\nEuclid's argument given in the next subsection\nshows there are infinitely many primes without giving a formula naming them.",
    "Finally, after\n“Are there any?” \nwe often ask “How many?”\nThat is, the question of uniqueness often arises in conjunction\nwith the question of existence.",
    "Sometimes the two arguments are simpler if separated so note that just as\nproving something exists does not show that it is unique,\nneither does proving that something is unique show that it exists.",
    "Techniques of Proof\n\nWe have many ways to prove mathematical statements.",
    "Here we will outline two techniques that we use often, and that\nmight not come naturally, even to a person with a technical \nturn of mind.",
    "Induction\n\nMany proofs are iterative,\n“Here's why the statement is true for the number 0, \nit then follows for 1 and from there to 2 …”.",
    "These are proofs by \nmathematical induction.",
    "We will see two examples.",
    "We will first prove that 1+2+3+…+n=n(n+1)/2.",
    "That formula has a natural number variable n\nthat is free, meaning that setting n to be 1,\nor 2, etc., gives a family of cases of the statement:\nfirst that 1=1(2)/2, second that 1+2=2(3)/2, etc.",
    "Our induction proofs involve statements with one free natural number \nvariable.",
    "Each such proof has two steps.",
    "In the base step\nwe show that the statement holds for\nsome intial number i∈.",
    "Often this step is a routine verification.",
    "The second step, \nthe inductive step,\nis more subtle; we will show that this implication holds:\n\n    If the statement holds from n=i up to and including n=k\n     then the statement holds also in the n=k+1 case*\n\n(the first line is the \ninductive hypothesis).",
    "Completing both steps proves that the statement is\ntrue for all natural numbers greater than or equal to i.",
    "For the sum of the initial n numbers statement  \nthe intuition behind the principle is that first, the base step directly \nverifies the statement for the case of the initial number n=1.",
    "Then, because the inductive step verifies the implication (*)\nfor all k, that implication applied to k=1\ngives that the statement is true for the case of the number\nn=2.",
    "Now, with the statement established for both 1 and 2, \napply (*) again to conclude that the statement is true for the number\nn=3.",
    "In this way, we bootstrap to all numbers n≥ 1.",
    "Here is a proof of 1+2+3+…+n=n(n+1)/2, \nwith separate paragraphs for the base step \nand the inductive step.",
    "For the base step we show that the formula holds when n=1.",
    "That's easy; the sum of the first 1 natural number equals \n1(1+1)/2.",
    "For the inductive step, assume the inductive hypothesis that the formula holds\nfor the numbers n=1, n=2, …, n=k with k≥ 1.",
    "That is, assume  \n1=1(1)/2, and 1+2=2(3)/2, and 1+2+3=3(4)/2, through  \n1+2+⋯+k=k(k+1)/2.",
    "With that, the formula holds also in the n=k+1 case:\n\n    1+2+⋯+k+(k+1)\n      =\n      k(k+1)/2+(k+1)\n      =\n      (k+1)(k+2)/2\n\n(the first equality follows from the inductive hypothesis).",
    "Here is another example, proving\nthat every integer greater than or equal to 2 is a product\nof primes.",
    "The base step is easy: 2 is the product of a single prime.",
    "For the inductive step assume that each of 2, 3,… ,k is a\nproduct of primes, aiming to show k+1 is also a product of\nprimes.",
    "There are two possibilities.",
    "First, if k+1 is not divisible by a number smaller than itself then it\nis a prime and so is the product of primes.",
    "The second possibility is that k+1 is divisible by a number\nsmaller than itself, and then  by the inductive hypothesis its\nfactors can be written as a product of primes.",
    "In either case\nk+1 can be rewritten as a product of primes.",
    "Contradiction\n\nAnother technique of proof is\nto show that something is true by showing that it cannot be false.",
    "A proof by contradiction assumes that the proposition is\nfalse and derives some contradiction to known facts.",
    "The classic example of proof by contradiction is Euclid's\nargument that there are infinitely many primes.",
    "Suppose that there are only finitely many primes p_1,…,p_k.",
    "Consider the number p_1· p_2… p_k +1.",
    "None of the primes on the supposedly exhaustive list divides this number\nevenly since each leaves a remainder of 1.",
    "But every number is a product of primes so this can't be.",
    "Therefore there cannot be only finitely many primes.",
    "Another example is this proof that\n√(2) is not a rational number.",
    "Suppose that  √(2)=m/n, so that 2n^2=m^2.",
    "Factor out any 2's, giving\nn=2^k_n·n̂\nand\nm=2^k_m·m̂.",
    "Rewrite.",
    "2· (2^k_n·n̂)^2\n      =\n      (2^k_m·m̂)^2\n\nThe Prime Factorization Theorem says that there must be the same number of\nfactors of 2 on both sides, but there are an odd number of them\n1+2k_n on the left and an even number 2k_m on the right.",
    "That's a contradiction, so a rational number with a square of\n2 is impossible.",
    "Sets, Functions, and Relations\nThe material here forms the backdrop, the vocabulary,\nfor all of the development that we do.",
    "Sets\n\nMathematicians often work with collections.",
    "The most commonly-used kind of collection is a set.",
    "Sets are characterized by the Principle of Extensionality: \ntwo sets with the same elements are equal.",
    "Because of this, the order of the elements does not matter \n2,π=π,2, \nand\nrepeats collapse 7,7=7.",
    "We can describe a set using a listing between curly braces\n1,4,9,16 (as in the prior paragraph), \nor by using set-builder notation\nx x^5-3x^3+2=0 (read “the set of all x\nsuch that …”).",
    "We name sets with capital roman letters; for instance the set of primes is\nP=2,3,5,7,11,… (except that a few sets \nare so important that their names are reserved, such as the\nreal numbers \nand the complex numbers ).",
    "To denote that something is an \nelement, \nor member,) of a set we\nuse `∈',\nso that 7∈3,5,7 while 8∉3,5,7.",
    "We say that A is a subset of B, written\nA⊆ B, when x∈ A implies that x∈ B.",
    "In this book we use\n`⊂' for the proper subset \nrelationship that A is a subset of B but A≠ B\n(some authors use this symbol for any kind of subset, proper or not).",
    "An example is \n2,π⊂2,π,7.",
    "These symbols may be flipped, for instance\n2,π,5⊃2,5.",
    "Because of Extensionality, to prove that two sets are equal A=B\nshow that they have the same members.",
    "Often we do this by showing mutual inclusion,\n\nthat both A⊆ B and A⊇ B.",
    "Such a proof will have a part showing that if x∈ A then x∈ B,\nand a second part showing that if x∈ B then x∈ A.",

    "A collection that is like a set in that order does not matter,\nbut in which repeats do not collapse, is a multiset.",
    "(Note that we use the same \ncurly brackets notation  … as for sets.)\nThus the multiset 1,2,2 differs from the multiset\n1,2.",
    "Because order does not matter, these multisets are all \nequal: 1,2,2, 2,1,2, and 2,2,1.",
    "In this text we only mention multisets in a remark so going into  \nhow to do subsets, unions, or intersections, is beyond our scope.",
    "Sequences\n\nIn addition to sets and multisets,\nwe also use collections where order matters and where repeats do\nnot collapse.",
    "These are sequences, denoted with angle brackets:\n2,3,7≠2,7,3.",

    "An \nidentity map \nYY defined by\n(y)=y has the property that for any f XY,\nthe composition f is equal to f.",
